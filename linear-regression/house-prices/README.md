# House prices

This project is an example of multivariable linear regression. 

The dataset has been gotten from the course "Machine Learning" by Stanford University on Coursera. The dataset contains area of the house, number of bedrooms and price of the house.
Because of huge difference between house area and number of bedrooms, the normalization was applyied.  

I did not use any tools like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn in this project. Only such libraries as Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib were involved. The aim of the project was to try the linear regression algorithm by myself.
