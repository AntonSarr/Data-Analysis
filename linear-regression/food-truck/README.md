# Food Truck

This is my first own machine learning script.

Here is a script predicting an income of the food truck depending on the size of a city where food truck is placed.
In this project I did not use Tensorflow, Scikit-lern and other tools for machine learning. The aim of the project was to study the alghorithms of the machine learning and understand how do they work.

Data for this project was gotten from the Coursera course "Machine Learning" - Stanford University.
