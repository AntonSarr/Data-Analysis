# Bike sharing

This is an example of multivariable linear regression. 

Dataset contains a lot of information about time, weather, and number of shared bikes. I apply linear regression to predict number of shared bikes using data about feeling temperature, if the day is working or not, and type of the weather (rainy, cloudy, sunny, etc).

Linear regression is actually not the best model for these dependeces, because after implementing gradient descent cost function  had still rather big value. But it is just an exercise and example, so I am going to apply another model for this dataset further.
